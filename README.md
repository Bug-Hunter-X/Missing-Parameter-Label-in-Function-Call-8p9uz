This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting parameter labels when calling functions. The `bug.swift` file contains code with this error, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version.  This is a subtle error that can be easily overlooked, especially when working with functions that have many parameters.  The error occurs because the Swift compiler needs the labels to understand which argument maps to which parameter in the function definition.
